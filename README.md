# Water tracking app

## About

This is a simple water tracking app that allowed me to get familiar with react.

## Installation and Setup Instruction

Make sure you have `node` and `npm` installed

For installation:
`npm install`

To start the app
`npm start`

To view the app
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Status

The app is extremely bare bones so there are a lot to be desire. A few things to note right off the bat:
- the table doesn't scroll so that needs to be fixed.
- having a daily goal is ideal
- tracking % is left for daily
- cleaning up the code
- Introduce redux for cross component states (over complicated for this project but to help me understand it better)
